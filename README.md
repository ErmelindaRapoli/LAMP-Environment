# LAMP-Environment
Let's easily create a local LAMP development environment, using Vagrant!

## Pre-requisities
### Install Vagrant
Installing Vagrant is extremely easy. Head over to the [Vagrant downloads page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and get the appropriate installer or package for your platform. Install the package using standard procedures for your operating system.

The installer will automatically add vagrant to your system path so that it is available in terminals. If it is not found, please try logging out and logging back in to your system (this is particularly necessary sometimes for Windows).
### Install VirtualBox
Download VirtualBox [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Start environment
After clone the repository, feel free to change Vagrantfile as you prefer.

If you need to know how Vagrant works, please read this guide [Getting started](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html)
